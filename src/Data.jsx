  parathree : "First, a caveat: I don’t need to tell anyone that building a business is really, really hard. That’s obvious.But in my experience⁠—and based on what I’ve learned from other founders I’ve spoken with⁠—it’s even harder to build a business when you’re not scratching your own itch. Ultimately, it’s that passion for solving my own problem that keeps me going through the lowest of the lows, and I know that many other founders feel the same way."

  parathree : "This is an issue that a lot of future entrepreneurs grapple with.It’s a tough one, and a deeply personal one.Without knowing details about your business, your job, your personal life and your finances, I can’t really give you an answer.But in every in-depth conversation I’ve had with people considering quitting their job, the wisest decision is “no” as often as it’s “yes.” And if you’re just now beginning to consider the prospect, it may be too early."
